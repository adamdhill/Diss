**Chapter 1**
A behavioral approach to contemporary electoral accountability


# Introduction 

Most theories of democracy find a central role for electoral accountability. Indeed, EA is one of the central institutional designs of the modern period. But how does EA work? How do hundreds of millions of discrete individuals exert control over an elected representative?  

The traditional model of electoral accountability has three serious shortcomings, however. *First*, the traditional model treats elected representatives as the primary actors in government. In fact, the demise of the non-delegation doctrine, and the rise of intra-government delegation, has increased the number of actors involved in making policy. *Second*, the traditional model divides the world into "lawmaking," which is endogenous to politics, and "probabilistic background factors," which are exogenous to politics. In fact, this divide is not nearly so neat. The rise of new regulatory tools, like nudging, has deeply complicated the relationship between endogenous and exogenous factors. *Third*, the traditional model assumes that congresspeople can change course when voters demand it. But this assumption sits uncomfortably with decades of jurisprudence holding that legal change must be slow and gradual, lest it upset reasonable expectations. 

This basic model of electoral accountability has driven half a century of research. It has contributed much to our understanding of how elections produce a correspondence between public outcomes and private preferences. 

# Traditional EA

Since the pathbreaking work of V.O. Key, theories of electoral accountability have sought to explain how, if at all, citizens use competitive elections to officials accountable and to identify the predictable consequences of electoral accountability.^[K.J. Arrow and A. Downs wrote alongside Key, and together the three defined the modern "economic" approach to democratic theory.] The theory has two main results. First, it explains how private information held by citizens is translated to public policy (more specifically, translated to the production of public goods). Second, it explains the "self-reinforcing" nature of democracy. That is, it explains why those in power chose to hold elections *at all* (as opposed to merely using the power they already possess).

In order to see why these two functions are crucial, consider the problem facing a benevolent dictator seeking to provide a set of common goods to the public. The first problem the benevolent dictator would face is that of determining just what goods to provide. The dictator might have his own ideas about what goods to provide. If the dictator knows the optimal basket of public goods to provide, then the solution to the challenge is simple. In this case, the dictator can simply raise funds for the goods and provide them. [@Maskin2008]

It is unlikely, however, that even an benevolent dictator can maximize net social surplus^[Defined as gross social benefit minus the cost of providing the goods.] alone. This is because net social surplus is a product of citizens' preferences. Just as one would not ordinarily expect an auctioneer to know how much individuals will bid, likewise we tend to think that governments will not know, ex ante, citizens' preferences.

The first goal of a theory of EA, therefore, is to explain how to extract this information from citizens and translate it into policy. The solution is as indirect as it is elegant. It depends on an insight, first formalized as an economic theory by Key, about the way in which rational voters use elected officials' past performance as the basis for future decisions. [@Key1966] Key hypoethesized that voters will hold officials accountable for policies that do not accord with voters' preferences. This threat of electoral sanction incentivizes officials to act in the public interest. Elections are "a sanctioning device that induces elected officials to do what the voters want," since "[t]he anticipation of not being reelected in the future leads elected officials not to shirk their obligations to the voters in the present."[@Fearon1999, p. 56] The voter, then, is the "rational god of vengeance and reward." [@Key1964, p. 568.]

The more successful the voter in doling out vengeance and reward, the less "agency slack" in the system of representative democracy. Agency slack represents the difference between what voters want, and what elected officials do. The less slack in the system, the more the electoral system promotes the preferences of voters. Hence, "[t]he standard justification for electoral democracy is that competitive elections give leaders an incentive to provide public goods and more generally to align public policy with citizens' preferences." [@Fearon2011, p. 1661] 

Promoting the preferences of voters is important because, on the economic model of democracy, "[v]oters and citizens are the ultimate principals of the policymaking process." [@Weingast1984, p. 151] "[C]ongressmen are" merely "their agents." [@Weingast1984, p. 151] Voters delegate power to elected representatives. Delegation is an implicit or explicit contract that conditionally grants "authority from a principal to an agent that empowers the latter to act on behalf of the former." [@Abbott2015, p. 3] Although a "contract" is in place between principal and agent, the agent is constrained primarily (and perhaps *totally*) by the sanctioning and reward mechanism. Principals select agents with regard to their governance capacity, not their governance goals. [@Abbott2015, p. 5] Sanctioning and reward mechanisms are what determines how the agent acts.    

Across political, economic, and social life, principals have ways of reducing the "agency costs" that inevitably arise when power is delegated.  These methods seek to reduce the costs of shirking, information asymmetries, monitoring costs, and so forth. In the context of democracy, elections are the primary tool^[They are not, however, the only tool. Separation of powers also operates to reduce agency slack, by reducing the probability that factional interests will confound the general will.] for citizen-principals to reduce the agency costs of a representative democracy. 

If elections are efficacious, officeholders' decisions are driven by a comparison of the present value benefit of two alternative income streams: the benefits of impressing the voters and (increasing the probability of) remaining in office versus the benefits of shirking and (increasing the probability of) leaving office. [@Barro1973] Although performance depends jointly on the actions of the officeholder and exogenous factors outside of the officeholder's control, the electorate is able to observe "simple performance metrics," such as the state of the economy. [@Malhotra2013, p. 286] If, as Ronald Reagan asked, voters are "better off [today] than [they] were four years ago," then the officeholder is likely to be reelected. [@Malhotra2013, p. 286]

Traditional EA treats such outcomes as an indication that "elected officials [did] what the voters want." [@Fearon1999, p. 56] We can assume that agent-representatives true preferences differ from those of his constituents. [@Barro1973, p. 25] That is, because the agent-representatives did what the public wants, they diverged from what *they* wanted to do. Thus, if voters are happy, we can assume that elections are operating to incentivize agent-representatives: elections are obliging agent-representatives to act in certain ways, on pain of sanction. [@Fearon1999, p. 55] This conclusion, in turn, allows an observer to conclude that a contractual agency relationship exists.

But why should elected officials, once in office, continue to fund and hold elections?^[This prospect seems a bit far fetched, but we might be witnessing a related phenomenon today in the form of gerrymandering. Gerrymandering is, in a sense, a way of avoiding the practical realities of elections without actually cancelling them.] Social contract theorists, such as Locke, recognized that the threat of rebellion can be used as a last resort to keep elected officials in line. The problem with this solution is it assumes that the citizenry has access to good information about incumbent perfomrance. In fact, in increasingly complex and technocratic societies, evaluating official performance from without is very difficult. The closest incumbents can come to demonstrating to the public that they are acting in the public's interest is to hold elections. [@Fearon2011] Of course, gross malfeasance might be revealed in any particular case. Nixon's recorded phone calls, for example, offered strong proof of malfeasance. But as an *institutional* solution, we can't rely on evidence of this sort emerging. Holding elections, with easily understood and public rules, offers an instituitonal solution to the coordination problem of evaluating incumbent performance, and thus incentivizes incumbents to fund and hold future elections. 

The continued maintenance of agency relationship, as confirmed by the existence of elections, authorizes otherwise ordinary individuals to govern through coercive measures. To put it differently, if we could *not* identify a mechanism through which public preferences were reliably turned into policy, we could conclude that the purported agent-representatives are, in fact, not authorized to govern coercively.          

In order to know how to evaluate how well Traditional EA functions, both empirically and normatively, we should consider the *type* of theory that is on offer. That is, What is the theory trying to do?

# What *is* a Theory of Electoral Accountability? A Brief Overview of Mechanism Design 

Traditional EA is one of the most successful instances of an approach to social science called "mechanism design." [@Maskin2008] Mechanism design "can be thought of as the 'engineering' side of economic theory," as opposed to the purely explanatory side of economic theory. [@Maskin2008, p. 567] It is useful to compare mechanism design to the more well-known fields of game theory and decision theory. Where game theory "takes the rules of the game as given, and [] makes predictions about the behavior of strategic players," mechanism design "is about the optimal choice of the rules of the game." [@Borgers2015, p. 2] For designers, identifying the optimal choice of rules typically depends on predicting how individuals will behave in certain environments. Both mechanism design and game theory, therefore, rely on identifying equilibriums -- that is, joint strategic solutions where no one involved has an incentive to deviate from the strategy that they are playing.[@Maskin2008, p. 571, fn. 4]   

In order to determine an optimal set of rules, the designer must have a set of goals to be achieved, or values.   


This decision is made by identifying a desired outcome and then seeking to create institutions that achieve that goal. ^["Mechanism design is narrower than "institutional design." The latter seeks all-in evaluations of institutions, a project that incorporates not only predictions about outcomes but also value considerations.] Alternatively, mechanism design my proceed by identifying real-world institutions and interpreting those institutions as a product of rational choices by their designers. [@Borgers2015] 

Traditional EA is an example of the latter category of mechanism design. It identifies a real-world institution (an electoral procedure) and interprets it as the product of a rational design intended to achieve a social goal. As we saw in the previous section, Traditional EA explains elections as institutions designed to transmit the preferences of discrete individuals to public policy. This outcome -- i.e., the existence of a principal-agent relationship -- is (taken to be) normatively valuable because it legitimates the rule of agent-representatives. COMPARE BEITZ AT PAGE 182

The mechanism designers behind Traditional EA aligned themselves with the social contract theory of democratic legitimacy. Hence, it was of utmost importance to explain how certain individuals could come to possess the power to coerce the population. One might deviate from this normative view and nonetheless still find Traditional EA (or variant thereof) to be normatively valuable, if one's preferred normative explanation has a large role for accountability of the sort described thus far. ^[For other types of accountability, see @Grant2005] 




Must capture -- The primary actors; the possible actions available to the actors; the consequences of the actions

Three empirical features of the traditional approach are particularly salient for our purposes. These three features stand out as out of step with current trends. 

First, the primary actors in the system are principal-voters and agent-representatives. The administrative state is not a meaningful part of the story. Traditional approaches have sought to incorporate the administrative state; but those accounts stress that "it is not a bureaucratic imperative that drives agency decisionmaking but rather a congressional-electoral one." [@Weingast1984, p. 149] Agencies that fail to adhere to congressional discipline are sanctioned; "political discipline and motivation for regulatory policy choice works through Congress." [@Weingast1984, p. 149]

Second, only the consequences of policy matter, not the intentions of representative-agents or the means they use to achieve their policies. The types of actions taken by the representative-agents are not themsleves consequential; rather, it is simply assumed that some actions are better for voters than are others. [@Ashworth2014, p. 567] The possible actions taken by the representative-agents are unlimited in theory. But the outcome of the analysis in no way depends on what actions are taken, only their consequences. As a result, the traditional account ignores (a) the intentions behind the act and (b) the mode of action.  

Third, the traditional model of electoral accountability treats policy change as costless.  

Normative significance: The relationship between citizens and elected representatives is validated. But the relationship between citizens and the rest of government is not. Agency relationships explain the normative significance of a relationship between principal and agent, but it struggles with explaining the relationship of third parties. This is particularly true when the third parties play a significant role. 

# Contemporary EA

After showing the empirical problems in the prior subsection, and the normative problems that creates, this section offers an empirical path for updating our inquiries. 

*Contemporary* EA updates the traditional study of electoral accountability in two primary ways. Empirically, it reflects substantive changes in the institutional environments that support electoral processes. Normatively, ***  In so doing, it remains empirically and normatively relevant.

At an empirical level, contemporary EA situates the study of electoral accountability in an environment that highlights important aspects of the contemporary political landscape. 

At a normative level, contemporary EA understands that electoral accountability has grown in significance beyond its original scope.  EA is particularly important for administrative law. Assumptions about how EA operates implicate legal doctrine and bureaucratic institutions.  

## Empirical updates

### Complexity

Policymaking has become more complex. Delegation not congress - many hands

Increasing number of actors

### New tools

Law is still very important, but there is a growth in new tools, like nudging  

Technocracy - new types of tools

### Change   

How do we deal with success? What happens when voters win?

Primary work product of legislators: laws

Our best thinking about law: it’s the kind of thing that must be stable

In other words, the legislators must change, but they can’t change law, lest reasonable expectations be upset.

This is at odds with fast changing world.

## Normative updates 

Implications for bureaucratic institutions  

# What we know about voters

VO Key famously declare voters the rational …

Generations of scholars have tested that claim.

"Michigan School": Voters are ignorant [@Malhotra2013]

Fiorina: voters can use simple performance metrics 

Lupia - Uninformed but rationally so [@Lupia1994]

Brennan - "epistocracy" - against democracy  

Fortunately, this dissertation is designed to avoid these questions. 

## A normative benchmark

Whatever nasty things you can say about voters' intelligence or beliefs, it is clear that they establish a normative benchmark.

Elections are at center of unrivaled normative hegemon. Kolodny2014 on democratic decision making

Whatever negative conclusions you might draw about voters ability to shape elections, it is clear that is has been *good enough* to be the lynchpin moment in an unrivaled institutional practice.

Voters perform *well enough* to ground the legitimacy of the practice. (Kutz- correspondence confirmed by electoral institutions- legitimacy. Legitimacy is product of practice and theory.)

## Accountability Architectures

If voters' performance in elections with traditional institutions is good enough to establish a normative benchmark, then going forward we should test capacity against that.

"Institutional design" is a popular field of public law. Designers identify problems associated with particular institutional arrangements and propose solutions. Sometimes those solutions are adopted. When they are, we cannot assume that individuals will perform as well at holding officials accountable as they did in the traditional arrangements.

We do *not* know how voters perform under conditions of COMPLEXITY and TOOLS. 

# A behavioral approach

The dissertation offers a *behavioral* approach to contemporary electoral accountability. This approach has two primary components.

Antecedents of the account in [@Anderson2007]

## Experimental

Experiments over theory

Using insights from economics, psychology and philosophy about the dynamics of group behavior and blame.  

### Self-interest through delegation 

Hamman

Delegate to powerless intermediary

Kutz

### Blameworthiness

Extensive literature 

Two ways to conceptualize blame. 

First, blameworthiness as necessary condition for electoral accountability

Second, blameworthiness as proxy for voting patterns - holding all else equal 

## Legal Realism 

Traditionally studies of EA depend on a rigid legal formalism. 

Traditional studies have little say to bat what happens afterwards.

This dissertation integrates into the study of EA a more contemporary view of law. I use the term "legal realism" not to denote the movement of the 1920s and 30s, ***. 

# Results

The results of this approach to electoral accountability are ***. 

## The bad news

In broadest terms, new accountability architectures appear to impede electoral accountability. 

Complexity and indirectness reduce the quality of individual judgments about blameworthiness.

## The good news

Debiasing and policy recommendations 

When change *does* occur due to electoral incentives, change is more possible than previously imagined.
