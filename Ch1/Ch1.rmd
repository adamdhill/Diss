A behavioral approach to contemporary electoral accountability 

Traditionally EA is the study of reductions in agency slack between congress and the people. Ashworth2012. Normative connection.

Contemporary EA must study something different if it is to remain empirically and normatively relevant. 

##Contemporary EA

###Complexity 

Policymaking has become more complex. Delegation not congress - many hands 

Increasing number of actors

###New tools 

Law is still very important, but there is a growth in new tools, like nudging  

Technocracy - new types of tools

###Change   

How do we deal with success? What happens when voters win? 

Primary workproduct of legislators: laws

Our best thinking about law: it’s the kind of thing that must be stable 

In other words, the legislators must change, but they can’t change law, lest reasonable expectations be upset. 

This is at odds with fast changing world. 

## What we know about voters

VO Key famously declare voters the rational … 
Generations of scholars have tested that claim. 
Depending on who you listen to, Voters are ignorant, rationally ignorant, …
Lupia - Uninformed 

###A normative benchmark

Whatever nasty things you can say about voters' intelligence or beliefs, it is clear that they establish a normative benchmark. 

But what is clear is that voting for representatives is the normative benchmark 

Elections are at center of unrivaled normative hegemon. Kolodny2014 on democratic decision making 

Whatever negative conclusions you might draw about voters ability to shape elections, it is clear that is has been *good enough* to be the lynchpin moment in an unrivaled institutional practice. 

Voters perform *well enough* to ground the legitimacy of the practice. Kutz- correspondence confirmed by electoral institutions- legitimacy. Legitimacy is product of practice and theory. 

Further analysis of Key’s original question is certainly not unwarranted. But it may well be beside the point.

### New tests 

What we need instead are fresh indicators of how well all of us - not just voters - are able to hold officials accountable for a new set of arrangements and practices. Those outlined above. 

Free and fair elections for congressional lawmaking is the normative benchmark. But politics pushes us in new directions. The three things. Benchmark vs three things. 

If voters' performance in elections with traditional institutions is good enough to establish a normative benchmark, then going forward we should test capacity against that. 

## A behavioral approach 

Experiments over theory 

Traditional studies have little say to bat what happens afterwards. They are built in a theory of law that is
