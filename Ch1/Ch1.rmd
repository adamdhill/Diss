A behavioral approach to contemporary electoral accountability

Traditionally EA is the study of reductions in agency slack between congress and the people. Ashworth2012. Normative connection.

*Contemporary* EA updates the traditional study of EA in two primary ways. Empirically, it reflects substantive changes in the institutional environments that support electoral processes. Legally, ***  In so doing, it remains empirically and normatively relevant.

# Contemporary EA

At a substantive level, contemporary EA situates the study of electoral accountability in an environment that highlights important aspects of the contemporary political landscape.

At a contextual level, contemporary EA understands that electoral accountability has grown in significance beyond its original scope. EA is particularly important for administrative law. Assumptions about how EA operates implicate legal doctrine and bureaucratic institutions.  

## Substantive

### Complexity

Policymaking has become more complex. Delegation not congress - many hands

Increasing number of actors

### New tools

Law is still very important, but there is a growth in new tools, like nudging  

Technocracy - new types of tools

### Change   

How do we deal with success? What happens when voters win?

Primary workproduct of legislators: laws

Our best thinking about law: it’s the kind of thing that must be stable

In other words, the legislators must change, but they can’t change law, lest reasonable expectations be upset.

This is at odds with fast changing world.

## A normative benchmark

Whatever nasty things you can say about voters' intelligence or beliefs, it is clear that they establish a normative benchmark.

But what is clear is that voting for representatives is the normative benchmark

Elections are at center of unrivaled normative hegemon. Kolodny2014 on democratic decision making

Whatever negative conclusions you might draw about voters ability to shape elections, it is clear that is has been *good enough* to be the lynchpin moment in an unrivaled institutional practice.

Voters perform *well enough* to ground the legitimacy of the practice. Kutz- correspondence confirmed by electoral institutions- legitimacy. Legitimacy is product of practice and theory.

Further analysis of Key’s original question is certainly not unwarranted. Further refining our understanding of traditional EA is important. But it may well be beside the point.

## New tests

Rather than [the exclusive study of how well voters reward and punish their representatives], a contemporary account of EA assesses (individuals' ability to provide external constraints to government action in) the ability of voters to reward and punish a broader and more diverse range of actors.  

This dissertation operationalizes this context in terms of the three factors mentioned above: complexity, technocracy, and change.

"Institutional design" is a popular field of public law. Designers identify problems associated with particular institutional arrangements and propose solutions. Sometimes those solutions are adopted. When they are, we cannot assume that individuals will perform as well at holding officials accountable as they did in the traditional arrangements.

If voters' performance in elections with traditional institutions is good enough to establish a normative benchmark, then going forward we should test capacity against that.

Experiments over theory

Traditional studies have little say to bat what happens afterwards. They are built in a theory of law that is
