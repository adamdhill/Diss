A behavioral approach to contemporary electoral accountability 

Traditionally EA is the study of reductions in agency slack between congress and the people. Ashworth2012. Normative connection.

Contemporary EA must study something different if it is to remain empirically and normatively relevant. 

##Contemporary EA

###Complexity 

Policymaking has become more complex. Delegation not congress - many hands 

Increasing number of actors

###New tools 

Law is still very important, but there is a growth in new tools, like nudging  

Technocracy - new types of tools
