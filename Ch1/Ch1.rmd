A behavioral approach to contemporary electoral accountability


# Introduction 

# Traditional EA

Since the pathbreaking work of V.O. Key, theories of electoral accountability have sought to explain how, if at all, citizens use competitive elections to officials accountable.^[K.J. Arrow and A. Downs wrote alongside Key, and together the three defined the modern "economic" approach to democratic theory.] Key sought to use economic models of decision making to explain how rational voters used officials' past performance as the basis for future decisions. [@Key1966] This threat of electoral sanction incentivizes officials to act in the public interest. On this model, elections are "a sanctioning device that induces elected officials to do what the voters want," since "[t]he anticipation of not being reelected in the future leads elected officials not to shirk their obligations to the voters in the present."[@Fearon1999, p. 56]  




EXPLAIN P-A DELEGATION IN TERMS OF (A) DIRECT, NON-COMPLEX RULE, (B) VIA LAW, (C) CHANGE LAW.

Originally, EA was thought to be of primary importance as a tool to understand how voters selected elected officials; (a) who ruled directly (b) through law. If EA is successful, it is assumed that (c) the law will change accordingly. 




The key to improving EA is reducing "agency slack." Abbott2015 on the PA relationship. Fundamentally about delegation. The people grant authority to elected representatives.  Traditionally EA is the study of reductions in agency slack between congress and the people. Ashworth2012. Normative connection. "Competitive elections create a relationship of formal accountability between policy makers and citizens - electoral rewards and punishments can be handed out on election day. Ideally, this formal accountability leads to better governance." [@Ashworth2012, p. 184]





The second step is to model how voters use this information. Put differently, what is the ``reelection rule'' that voters use to make decisions about incumbents and their challengers?\cite{Ashworth2012} Two types of rules stand out: those premised on sanctions, and those premised on selection.\footnote{These two models are not mutually exclusive; they might be combined in various ways.\cite{Fearon1999} Here we present the two pure types.} More abstractly, the sanctions model is a pure moral hazard model, while the selection model is an adverse selection model.\cite[p. 7]{Mesquita.draft}

On the sanctions model, elections ``a sanctioning device that induces elected officials to do what the voters want,'' since ''[t]he anticipation of not being reelected in the future leads elected officials not to shirk their obligations to the voters in the present.''\cite[p. 56]{Fearon1999} Voters' actions are a function of ``their evaluations of officeholders on their actual performance in office rather than on hypothetical promises they might make during a campaign.''\cite[p. 6]{Ferejohn1986} If we assume that voters treat elections thusly, the Executive will be incentivized to exercise what control it does have over agencies to enact popular policies. Applying this view of elections to the DA model, the Executive will be incentivized to enact a ``regulatory vision'' that ``represents the majority will,''\cite[p. 491]{Bressman2003} or else face punishment.  

A more forward looking approach to election is the selection model. Whereas the sanctions model assumed that candidates vying for office are homogenous, and are only distinguished by their policy choices, the selection model assumes the opposite. Voters seek to install officials that match their own ``type.'' [***FILL IN***] ``[V]oters can use the policy choices of politicians to draw inferences about their underlying characteristics ...''\cite[p. 831]{Fox2011}

DA fits most naturally with the sanctions model, but it is not incompatible with the selection model. While election promises are cheap talk, actions reveal information about a candidate's true type. Thus, actions of the agency can reveal information about the type of the Executive (which, presumably, the executive knows, and is incentivized accordingly). 













# Contemporary EA

*Contemporary* EA updates the traditional study of EA in two primary ways. Empirically, it reflects substantive changes in the institutional environments that support electoral processes. Normatively, ***  In so doing, it remains empirically and normatively relevant.

At an empirical level, contemporary EA situates the study of electoral accountability in an environment that highlights important aspects of the contemporary political landscape. 

At a normative level, contemporary EA understands that electoral accountability has grown in significance beyond its original scope.  EA is particularly important for administrative law. Assumptions about how EA operates implicate legal doctrine and bureaucratic institutions.  

## Empirical updates

### Complexity

Policymaking has become more complex. Delegation not congress - many hands

Increasing number of actors

### New tools

Law is still very important, but there is a growth in new tools, like nudging  

Technocracy - new types of tools

### Change   

How do we deal with success? What happens when voters win?

Primary work product of legislators: laws

Our best thinking about law: it’s the kind of thing that must be stable

In other words, the legislators must change, but they can’t change law, lest reasonable expectations be upset.

This is at odds with fast changing world.

## Normative updates 

Implications for bureaucratic institutions  

# What we know about voters

VO Key famously declare voters the rational …

Generations of scholars have tested that claim.

"Michigan School": Voters are ignorant [@Malhotra2013]

Fiorina: voters can use simple performance metrics 

Lupia - Uninformed but rationally so [@Lupia1994]

Brennan - "epistocracy" - against democracy  

Fortunately, this dissertation is designed to avoid these questions. 

## A normative benchmark

Whatever nasty things you can say about voters' intelligence or beliefs, it is clear that they establish a normative benchmark.

Elections are at center of unrivaled normative hegemon. Kolodny2014 on democratic decision making

Whatever negative conclusions you might draw about voters ability to shape elections, it is clear that is has been *good enough* to be the lynchpin moment in an unrivaled institutional practice.

Voters perform *well enough* to ground the legitimacy of the practice. (Kutz- correspondence confirmed by electoral institutions- legitimacy. Legitimacy is product of practice and theory.)

## Accountability Architectures

If voters' performance in elections with traditional institutions is good enough to establish a normative benchmark, then going forward we should test capacity against that.

"Institutional design" is a popular field of public law. Designers identify problems associated with particular institutional arrangements and propose solutions. Sometimes those solutions are adopted. When they are, we cannot assume that individuals will perform as well at holding officials accountable as they did in the traditional arrangements.

We do *not* know how voters perform under conditions of COMPLEXITY and TOOLS. 

# A behavioral approach

The dissertation offers a *behavioral* approach to contemporary electoral accountability. This approach has two primary components.

Antecedents of the account in [@Anderson2007]

## Experimental

Experiments over theory

Using insights from economics, psychology and philosophy about the dynamics of group behavior and blame.  

### Self-interest through delegation 

Hamman

Delegate to powerless intermediary

Kutz

### Blameworthiness

Extensive literature 

Two ways to conceptualize blame. 

First, blameworthiness as necessary condition for electoral accountability

Second, blameworthiness as proxy for voting patterns - holding all else equal 

## Legal Realism 

Traditionally studies of EA depend on a rigid legal formalism. 

Traditional studies have little say to bat what happens afterwards.

This dissertation integrates into the study of EA a more contemporary view of law. I use the term "legal realism" not to denote the movement of the 1920s and 30s, ***. 

# Results

The results of this approach to electoral accountability are ***. 

## The bad news

In broadest terms, new accountability architectures appear to impede electoral accountability. 

Complexity and indirectness reduce the quality of individual judgments about blameworthiness.

## The good news

Debiasing and policy recommendations 

When change *does* occur due to electoral incentives, change is more possible than previously imagined.
